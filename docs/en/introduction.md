# Introduction to the Finite Element Method (FEM)

## Why CAx?

Modern product development increasingly relies on digital tools to reduce development time and cost. CAx technologies such as CAD, FEM, and PDM play a key role in this.

- **Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)** often lack a dedicated simulation team. → Designers perform FEM analysis themselves.
- **Large companies** have specialized departments. → Close coordination with design is essential.

## Course Objectives

This course teaches the fundamentals of applying FEM in mechanical engineering:

- Using simulation as a design tool
- Verifying strength and safety of components
- Introduction to dynamic analysis (modal analysis)
- Hands-on training with ANSYS Workbench and Creo

## Typical FEM Questions

- Is my component stable and strong enough?
- Where do critical stresses occur?
- How can I reduce weight?
- What are the natural frequencies of my system?
