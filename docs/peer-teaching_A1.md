# Peer Teaching: A1 Symmetry and Model Reduction

## Goal  

- Many engineering models contain repeated or mirrored geometry.
- Using symmetry reduces model size → faster solve times, less memory, but same accuracy.
- ANSYS Workbench supports symmetry in geometry, meshing, loads, and boundary conditions.

## Why Use Symmetry?  

- Reduces model size by 50–90%.
- Allows finer meshing (higher accuracy) at same computational cost.
- Simplifies model setup when geometry and loading are symmetric.
- Useful for stress analysis, modal analysis, thermal problem

## Conditions for Axisymmetric Modeling

- Geometry revolves around a central axis.
- Load is uniformly distributed along the circumference (e.g., internal pressure).
- Boundary conditions are rotationally uniform.
- Not suitable when:
- Loads vary with angle (e.g., point load).
- Geometry has protrusions or cutouts not repeated around the full 360°

## Creating an Axisymmetric Model (Workflow Overview)

Geometry:

- Create or import a 2D sketch
- Define the axis of symmetry  
- Assign material
- Set body to Axisymmetric
- Apply loads/boundary conditions
- Mesh (2D mesh)
- Solve and interpret results

## Theoretical Background

Using symmetry in numerical analysis allows reduction of the geometric model, the degrees of freedom, and thus the computation time. A model reduction is valid only if geometry, loads, boundary conditions, and material properties all exhibit appropriate symmetry. Only then a reduced part model is fully equivalent to the full model.

### Symmetry Conditions

To use symmetry, **four conditions** must be satisfied simultaneously:

1. **Geometric symmetry** — the part can be divided by one or more planes or axes into identical sub-parts (e.g. half, quarter, eighth, axial or cyclic symmetry).  
2. **Material symmetry** — material behavior must be identical in all symmetric sub-parts; isotropic materials automatically satisfy this.  
3. **Load symmetry** — loads must act consistently across all symmetric sub-parts. A surface pressure typically satisfies this automatically; a single force must be correctly partitioned among the sub-parts.  
4. **Boundary condition symmetry** — boundary conditions must be equivalent on all symmetric sub-parts; asymmetric support or constraints in different sub-parts invalidate symmetry.  

If all conditions are met, one may compute a suitable sub-part instead of the full model. On the symmetry planes, the displacement normal to the plane is suppressed; tangential motion remains permitted. This yields large reduction in degrees of freedom and computation time, without losing accuracy of results.

### Typical Symmetry Types

- **Planar symmetry** (mirror symmetry about a plane — e.g. XY, XZ, YZ)  
- **Axial (rotational) symmetry** — e.g. for cylinders, vessels, discs, flanges  
- **Cyclic symmetry** — identical repeating segments around an axis, e.g. flanges with bolt-hole circles, turbine or gear disks  

### Pressure vs. Force in Sub-Models

- **Pressure** (surface load) remains unchanged in sub-models — because pressure is defined per unit area.  
- **Force** (integrated load) must be scaled proportional to the fraction of volume / surface being modeled:  

$$F_r = \alpha F, \qquad \alpha = \frac{\text{volume (or area) of sub-model}}{\text{volume (or area) of full model}}$$

## Axisymmetric 2D-to-3D Volume Relation

In ANSYS, the 2D cross-section is treated as a 3D body rotated 360°:

V=A⋅2πr

This formula is how ANSYS converts the 2D area into a full 3D model.
This formula converts a 2D area (A) into a 3D volume (V) by rotating it around a central axis at a radius (r).

V=A×(circumference of the rotation)

Since the circumference of a full circle is:

the total volume created by sweeping the 2D area around the axis is:

$$
v =A.2πr
$$

## Why ANSYS uses this formula

- When you create an axisymmetric model in ANSYS Workbench:
- You only draw a 2D cross-section of the part.
- ANSYS assumes this cross-section is rotated 360° around the symmetry axis.
- To compute real 3D stiffness, loads, and mass, ANSYS needs to know what 3D volume that 2D area represents.
- So ANSYS multiplies the 2D area (A) by the circular path length (2πr) to produce the correct 3D volume.

## Simple Example

Imagine drawing a small rectangle in 2D representing the wall of a pipe.

If this rectangle has area  

$$
A = 10 \, \text{mm}^2
$$

and it is located at a radius of

$$
r = 50\, \text{mm}
$$

then the 3D volume generated by rotating it around the center is:
$$
V = 10 \cdot 2\pi(50)
$$

$$
V = 3141.6 \, \text{mm}^3
$$

This is the actual volume of the pipe wall in 3D.

## Task — Flange Example

A stepped cylindrical flange is subjected to a uniform pressure applied to the top face of the smaller cylinder. The component is supported at the bottom by a frictionless support. Because the geometry and loading are symmetric about the central axis, exploit axisymmetry to reduce computation time.

**Load cases:**  

- Case A: Internal pressure of 200 bar  
- Case B: Tensile force of 100 kN applied to the flange end faces  

Use the provided geometry of the flange and its reduced variants (symmetry, Model Reduction 1, Model Reduction 2, Model Reduction 3, Model Reduction 4 ).  

**Geometry variants (files):**  

- `Model symmetry`
- `Model Reduction 1`  
- `Model Reduction 2`  
- `Model Reduction 3`  
- `Model Reduction 4`  

**Material:** “FlangeSteel450”  

- Young’s modulus E = 70000 MPa  
- Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.33

## Model Reduction in ANSYS Workbench

### 1. Introduction to Model Reduction

Model reduction is a powerful simulation technique used to simplify large and complex finite element models while preserving their essential physical behavior.

In **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, model reduction is mainly used for:

- Structural dynamics
- Modal analysis
- System-level simulation
- Digital twins and real-time simulation

The output of model reduction is called a **Reduced Order Model (ROM)**.

## 2. Why Model Reduction is Important

Modern engineering simulations often contain:

- Millions of degrees of freedom (DOF)
- Long computation times
- High memory and hardware demands

### Benefits of model reduction

- Reduces simulation time by **90–99%**
- Enables **real-time simulation**
- Supports **faster design optimization**
- Enables simulations for **control systems and digital twins**

## 3. Areas Where Model Reduction Is Used in ANSYS

Model reduction is commonly applied in:

- Modal Analysis
- Harmonic Response Analysis
- Transient Structural Analysis
- System Coupling
- Twin Builder
- Design Optimization

---

## 4. Mathematical Principle of Model Reduction

The full structural dynamic equation is:

$$
M\ddot{x} + C\dot{x} + Kx = F
$$
Where:

- `M` = Mass matrix  
- `C` = Damping matrix  
- `K` = Stiffness matrix  
- `x` = Displacement vector  
- `F` = Applied force vector  

After reduction, it becomes:  

$$Mrq̈ + Crq̇ + Krq = Fr$$

Where:

- `q` = Reduced system coordinates  
- `r` = Reduced system order  

This drastically lowers computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
